# Latest Date Updater
A Tableau extension that automatically updates a parameter to the most recent date in a data source.

## How to use
Using version 2018.2 or higher drag an extension object to your dashboard and choose the Latest Date Updater [manifest file](https://keshiarose.github.io/latest-date-updater/LatestDateUpdater.trex).

1. Choose the data source and field you want to use as the source.
2. Choose the parameter you want to update.
3. Save

Note: This extension requires full data access and therefore will not work for *Viewer* accounts.

**Also note: This is not an official Tableau extension. Just something I threw together so it won't have the nice checks and balances that I usually do. If you change parameters or fields or data sources it will break and require reconfiguration.**
